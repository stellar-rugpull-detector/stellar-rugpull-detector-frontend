# Stellar Rug-Pull Detector

> A real-time analytics and risk intelligence platform built on the Stellar ecosystem — scanning tokens, issuers, liquidity pools, and DEX activity to detect scams, malicious tokenomics, liquidity drains, fake assets, wash trading, and centralized supply concentration **before** users interact with risky assets.

---

## What Is This?

Think of it as **TokenSniffer + RugCheck + DEXTools — built natively for Stellar**.

The Stellar ecosystem has grown significantly with Soroban smart contracts, AMMs, and cross-chain asset issuance — but security and analytics tooling remain far behind Ethereum and Solana. This project fills that gap by providing a deep on-chain risk intelligence layer for Stellar DeFi.

**Monitors in real-time:**
- Native Stellar DEX orderbooks
- Soroban AMMs (Soroswap, Aquarius, Phoenix)
- Token issuers and trustline behavior
- Liquidity movements and ownership
- Wallet concentration and insider clusters
- Sudden minting/burning events
- Suspicious transaction graphs
- Fake verified assets and honeypot behavior

---

## Core Features

### 🔍 Token Risk Scanner
Analyzes supply distribution, issuer ownership, mint/freeze/burn permissions, whale concentration, and locked liquidity. Outputs a clear safety rating:

| Rating | Description |
|---|---|
| ✅ Safe | No significant risk indicators |
| ⚠️ Moderate Risk | Some flags, proceed with caution |
| 🔴 High Risk | Multiple red flags detected |
| ☠️ Potential Rug | Active rug indicators present |

### 💧 Liquidity Monitoring Engine
Tracks LP creation, withdrawals, lock duration, and sudden drains. Detects soft rugs, hard rugs, and exit liquidity setups before they execute.

### 🐋 Wallet Concentration Analysis
Flags wallets holding >50% of supply, connected insider clusters, Sybil wallets, and developer wallet dumping patterns using graph analysis.

### 📊 Wash Trading Detection
Identifies repeated buy/sell loops, same-wallet routing, volume inflation, and circular trading graphs to surface fake volume.

### 🎭 Fake Asset Detection
Detects copycat asset codes (fake USDC/USDT), missing `stellar.toml`, suspicious issuer domains, and fake anchors — critical given Stellar's trustline-based asset model.

### 📈 Trustline Analytics
Monitors rapid trustline spikes, bot-created trustlines, and mass account creation used to fake adoption metrics.

### 🚨 Real-Time Alert System
Pushes alerts when liquidity drops suddenly, developers mint supply, whales dump, or suspicious contracts appear.

**Channels:** Telegram · Discord · Email · Push Notifications · WebSocket Feeds

### 🖥️ Risk Dashboard
Visual interface showing risk scores, holder graphs, liquidity charts, wallet heatmaps, whale activity, and rug probability.

## Smart Contracts (Soroban)

| Contract | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `verification-registry` | Stores verified assets, approved issuers, reputation scores |
| `community-reporting` | Scam reports, community voting, DAO moderation |
| `staking-reputation` | Users stake tokens to validate assets, earn rewards, penalize false reports |
| `decentralized-alert-feed` | On-chain alert publishing for trustless risk data |

---

## Risk Scoring Model

Each asset receives a composite risk score weighted across:

| Factor | Weight |
|---|---|
| Issuer concentration | 25% |
| LP ownership | 20% |
| Wallet clustering | 15% |
| Sudden minting | 15% |
| Wash trading | 10% |
| Trustline manipulation | 10% |
| Fake metadata | 5% |

| **API Subscription** | Risk feeds, wallet analytics, DEX intelligence |
| **Institutional** | Full analytics suite for exchanges, funds, compliance teams |
| **Token Audits** | Paid on-chain audits for project launches |

---

## Security Considerations

- Rate limiting on all public endpoints
- Multi-node validation to prevent oracle spoofing
- Reputation systems to penalize fake reports
- Signed data feeds for tamper-proof risk scores
- Sybil-resistant voting via staking

---

## Why This Matters

Stellar's DeFi ecosystem is expanding rapidly with Soroban, AMMs, and cross-chain asset issuance — but security tooling is still nascent compared to Ethereum or Solana. This project aims to become:

- The **primary security layer** for Stellar DeFi
- A **risk oracle** for wallets and DEXs
- An **institutional analytics platform** for compliance and due diligence
- A **community-owned** scam detection network via DAO governance
